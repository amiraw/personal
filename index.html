        <p class="font">My name is Amira Warren and I am an upcoming senior at King College Prep. I grew up in Chicago, IL and I have three little sisters and two older brothers. I am also 17 years old and  hope to attending Spelman College next fall. I made this website so people could get to know me better. Enjoy!</p>
